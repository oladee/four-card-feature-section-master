### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
        grid-template-rows: repeat(8, 100px);
        grid-template-areas:
                            ". team ."
                            ". team ."
                            "superi team cal"
                            "superi karma cal"
                            "superi karma cal"
                            ". karma .";
        column-gap: 30px;
}
```

### Continued development

This project tested my ability to be able to use css grid to be able to set a responsive row, column design for the large screen sze view, although starting at first i wasn't sure about how to go about it, it all became clearer with each new construct, i still look forward to learning more on css grid and its complexities, due to how much of a powerful tool it is.
